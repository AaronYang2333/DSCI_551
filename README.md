# INF_551 (Foundations of Data Management) Homeworks Respority

#### Function and design of modern storage systems, including cloud; data management techniques; data modeling; network attached storage, clusters and data centers; relational databases; the map-reduce paradigm.

## Homework_1 (Firebase and JSON)
In this homework, we consider the LA restaurants health inspection data set: restaurants.csv, in the CSV format. We are only concerned with two columns in the data set: serial_number, facility_name and score.

## Homework_2 (XML and Xpath)
Consider an XML document: books.xml, which stores a catalog of books. Each book has a unique id and several attributes like author and title. In this homework, you are asked first to build an inverted index and then use the index to facilitate the searching of books. Specific tasks are as follows.

## Homework_3 (SQL)
Consider again the LA Restaurants & Market Health data set available at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/la-restaurant-market-health-data. In particular, we consider the two CSV files: one for inspections; the other for violations.

## Homework_4 (B+ Tree & External Sorting)
- Consider the following B+tree for the search key â€œage. Suppose the degree d of the tree = 2, that is, each node (except for root) must have at least two keys and at most 4 keys.
- Consider natural-joining tables R(a, b) and S(a,c).

## Homework_5 (Hadoop & Spark)
- Write a Hadoop MapReduce program, count.java, that takes the Sells table (stored as a comma-separated-value or CSV file) in the beers database, and computes the same results as the following SQL query. You can assume that there are no NULL prices in the table.
- For each of the following queries, write a Spark program in Python to implement the query. Assume that all tables in the beers database are stored in the CSV files
